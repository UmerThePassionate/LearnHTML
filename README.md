<h1> HTML Introduction </h1>


<h3> What is HTML? </h3>

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

<h2> A Simple HTML Document </h2>

#### Example

``` 
   
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```


### Example Explained


- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
- The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
- The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The <h1> element defines a large heading
- The <p> element defines a paragraph.

<h2> What is an HTML Element? </h2>

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

     <h3> <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname> </h3>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
```
<h3> <h1>My First Heading</h1> </h3>
<h3> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </h3>
```

     
</h3>

<h2>Web Browsers</h2>


The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

<h1>HTML Editors</h1>

A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.

### Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit

Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

<h2> Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) </h2>

- Windows 8 or later:

- Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.

- Windows 7 or earlier:

- Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad

<h2>Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)</h2>

- Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit

- Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"

- Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".

- Then open a new document to place the code.

<h2>Step 2: Write Some HTML</h2>

Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

<h2>Step 3: Save the HTML Page </h2>

Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.

Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).

![example2](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_saveas.png)<br><br>

<h2>Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser </h2>

Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

The result will look much like this:
